# Bug Bounty Debugger Project Report

## Project Overview
The Bug Bounty Debugger is a tool designed to detect code flaws with efficient time and space complexity analysis. It provides both a web interface and backend services to analyze code snippets, primarily focusing on JavaScript but with recent improvements to support multiple languages.

## Key Components

### 1. Server (server.js)
- Built using Node.js and Express framework.
- Serves static frontend files from the `public` directory.
- Hosts a WebSocket server to handle real-time code analysis requests.
- Provides a REST API endpoint `/api/analyze` for code analysis via HTTP POST requests.
- Listens on port 3000 by default.

### 2. Analyzer (analyzer.js)
- Core module responsible for analyzing code snippets.
- Uses Esprima and Estraverse libraries to parse and traverse JavaScript code AST.
- Detects specific code patterns such as `console.log` statements and flags them as issues.
- Recently enhanced to support analysis of any programming language:
  - For JavaScript, it performs AST-based analysis.
  - For other languages, it performs generic text-based analysis, such as detecting TODO comments.
- Returns analysis results including detected errors and a flag indicating if the code is flawless.

### 3. Frontend (public directory)
- Contains static assets including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- Provides the user interface for submitting code snippets for analysis and displaying results.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- WebSocket (ws library)
- Esprima (JavaScript parser)
- Estraverse (AST traversal)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `npm start`.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
5. Use the web interface to submit code snippets for analysis.

## Recent Improvements
- Enhanced the analyzer to support multiple programming languages.
- Added generic analysis for non-JavaScript code to detect TODO comments.
- Improved error handling to avoid crashes on unsupported code.

## Potential Future Improvements
- Integrate language detection libraries for more accurate language identification.
- Add support for more detailed analysis rules for various programming languages.
- Implement user authentication and session management.
- Enhance the frontend with better UI/UX and real-time feedback.
- Add logging and monitoring for better diagnostics.
